# DataTrust.py - A python library for creating and managing multi-party data collaboration

## Why DataTrusts.py

Helping multiple organizations collaborate with data is hard. A Data Trust provides an informational and organizational framework for facilitating collaboration with data among organizations.

However, setting up and managing a data trust is harder than it should be.

DataTrusts.py provides a multi-graph metadata model and tooling to support discovery, sharing, and governance

You can host your trustfile for discoverability by other network members

- Generate metadata for data resources you own
- Make your metadata discoverable and explorable by other parties you trust
- Facilitate the discovery of potential multi-party combinations of data
- Define ownership relationships and governance rules for combined data resources
- Manage data provenance over data processes combining data
- Define access on combined data resources
